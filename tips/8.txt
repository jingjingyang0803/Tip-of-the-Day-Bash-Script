Ignoring redirection
If cat(1) is passed to an argument, it assumes the argument is the name of the file(s) to print.
$ cat file1 < file2
If cat receives no arguments, it reads the stdin.
cat < new.file.tmp
date(1), ls(1), cd, mkdir(1) does not check its standard input and the redirection has no effect.
ls < test.tmp
